This project represents a simple bank & clients/employees management system: which allows several transactions as presented:
 
•	Withdrawal. 
•	Depositing. 
•	Deleting data.
•	Updating data.
•	Inserting data. 
•	Showing clients data.
•	Showing employees data.
•	Modifying clients data.

Starting with the first tab “bank info”… main welcome text in the upper part of the screen, then after it a whole table about the branches of the bank, coming after a table that represents the complete details of the employees from their IDs, names to which branch they work at.
As tab #2 labeled “enquiry about clients”, it allows you to have a full-detailed enquiry when entering the desired client’s ID you will have his “name, account, number & which branch he works at”
Rushing through tab #3 as “clients’ accounts” here you can show, edit, update or delete all data about clients in addition to withdrawal/depositing money… in the upper section there is a table that shows clients “IDs, name, account, phone number & bank branch”. While withdrawing if the client entered a number, more than his account an error message appears informing him that this transaction cannot be done, on other hand if the withdrawal/depositing transaction happened successfully then a confirming message appears informing that your withdraw/deposit was a success. While those transactions cannot took place if the client provided not enough data or withdrawing an amount exceeding the original account by a pop-up message as the error requires.      
Heading towards last tab #4 labeled “Process info” designed to show the last made transactions in details as in order “employee, bank branch, timing & type of process”. As timing refers to the time when desired transaction took place at.
Some notes about the system:
1.	As system assigned the bank has three different branches in “Cairo, Alexandria & Giza” 
2.	Each client/employee has an ID, name, account, phone number & bank branch associated to.
3.	After completing the transaction, a pop-up message will show informing the client that his order was a success.
